• Innovated a custom pruning algorithm for the AlexNet architecture, focusing on optimizing network efficiency by
identifying and eliminating underperforming neurons and weights, reducing model FLOPS by 11.23%
• Implemented a strategic layer-wise pruning approach guided by performance metrics and relevance analysis,
ensuring optimal balance between model size and classification performance on the MNIST dataset.
• Can be modified for use with various models and datasets.
